This project is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Module.
This chatbot aims to:
1. Finding the cheapest train ticket
   - The objectives of this task are to get the necessary information from a user for their intended train journey through a series of dialogue and then find the cheapest available train ticket for the journey from some appropriate train ticket booking web sites.
2. Improving Customer Service
   - The chatbot asks the passenger for necessary information and it should then present the gathered information (data) to a predictive model to predict the arrival time of the delayed train at specified destination.
3. Providing advice for dealing with contingencies
   - Extend the chatbot system to provide train operational staff with some suggested plans in accordance with the relevant regulations for dealing with contingencies through a conversational interface.
